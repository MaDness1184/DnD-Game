  storyText: "Attempt Success!\nYour expert sneak has allowed you to remain muffled
    in the dark. You can hear the beast growl and thump around the cave but it cannot
    seem to find you.\r\n\r\nAs you continue to hug the wall you almost trip on a
    cellar door. You don't hesitate to swing it open, the loud creeking noise attracts
    the attention of the beast.\r\nThump, thump, thump! The beast charges you and
    roars but before it can reach you, you quickly slam the plank shut. You can hear
    scratching and roaring from the other side but eventually the beast gives up and
    you can hear silence on the other side.\r\n\r\nWhat have I gotten myself into?\r\n1.
    To continue\r\n2. To continue"
