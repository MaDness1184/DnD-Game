  storyText: "You grab the hilt of your sword and quickly unshieth a small broadsword
    from the hilt. The beast comes closer and stops right in front of you. It lets
    out a loud roar and you can see it is a very large bear! When its paws touch the
    floor it lunges at you, and as its swiping at your head you stick your sword right
    in its heart.\r\n\r\nThe beast whines and goes limp. With all the strength you
    can muster you manage to push the big beast off you.\r\n\r\n1. To continue\r\n2.
